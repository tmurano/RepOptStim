Abstract: Activation of neurons triggers plastic changes in neural circuits that are essential for brain development, learning and memory, but overactivation can lead to pathological alterations. Here, we show that repeated neural activation induces long-term changes in the nuclear structure of neurons, persisting for two weeks. These alterations involve the disruption of nuclear lamina and epigenetic changes, which partially resemble the G2-M phase in cycling cells, accompanied by alterations in the transcriptome, chromatin accessibility, neural coding of information, and locomotor activity in mice. These cell cycle-like changes and hyper-locomotor activity were mitigated by in vivo gene knockout of cyclin B, a molecule essential for G2-M phase transition. Our results demonstrate that subchronic neural activation reinstates a cell cycle-like process, leading to chronic changes in neuronal function and abnormal behavior. Our findings provide novel insights into activity-dependent plastic changes in neuronal circuits, which may be relevant to the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders.
